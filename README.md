# **Schechter Function Simulation and Sky Map Generation**

## **Overview**
This project simulates the distribution of flux sources following a Schechter luminosity function. It generates a histogram of sampled luminosities, plots the corresponding cumulative distribution function (CDF), and creates a 2D sky map with a Gaussian beam applied.

## **Installation**

To run this project, you'll need to have Python 3 installed along with the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`
- `astropy`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib astropy
